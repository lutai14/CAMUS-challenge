Medical imaging technology has significantly improved the quality of healthcare, with methods such as MRI, CT and Ultrasound imaging. While MRI's provide valuable information for medial diagnosis, its cost of operation is substantial and limits the wide applicability of the method. Other imaging methods, such as ultrasound imaging, are far cheaper to operate. This is not without drawbacks however, as the produced images are not three dimensional and of significantly lower resolution than an MRI. Echocardiograms produced by ultrasound scanners are often noisy, and it is difficult to distinguish the appropriate anatomical parts. However, this does not render them useless. Coronary heart disease is a major cause of death worldwide. Cheap diagnosis can help medical professionals in their work, and echocardiographic imaging can be used for this. However, manually annotation or processing these images using experts is time consuming, and could benefit from automatic tools.

The CAMUS (Cardiac Acquisitions for Multi-structure Ultrasound Segmentation) challenge has been set out to improve segmentation of 2D echocardiographic images. The authors released a publicly available, 500 patient dataset to allow for comparable results across heart segmentation research. The nature of ultrasound imaging produces noisy images that are difficult to understand and accurately segment the cardiac regions. These segmentations can, for example, be used to diagnose coronary heart disease.

## The dataset
The CAMUS challenge uses the largest publicly-available and fully-annotated dataset for 2D echocardiographic assessment. It contains 2D apical four-chamber and two-chamber view sequences acquired from 500 patients and is made available for download [here](http://camus.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/challenge/#challenges).

### Data preparation
Please follow the steps below:
- Register your account on the [download website](http://camus.creatis.insa-lyon.fr/challenge/#challenges) and download both _training_ and _testing_ data.
- Extract the compressed files (`training.zip` and `testing.zip`), and move the resulting folders to the `/data` directory of the repository.

## Model Trainings

### U-Net implementation
Firstly, we have used a forked version of [ADD GINO BASELINE GITHUB REPO] for the training of the UNet. However, for the implementation of the self-supervised we needed to heavily modify the low-level structure of UNet (modification of the forward pass). For this reason we have implemented our own version of UNet, which can be found in the [unet.py](https://github.com/lutai14/CAMUS-challenge/blob/main/gino_baseline/unet.py) script. We also added [Albumenations](https://albumentations.ai/docs/api_reference/augmentations/transforms/) transforms in the training pipeline. The training is done in the [Training Notebook](https://github.com/lutai14/CAMUS-challenge/blob/main/gino_baseline/train.ipynb).

### VICReg - Self-Supervised learning implementation
he goal is to leverage the unlabeled in-between frames of the recordings to help build meaningful representations. We apply a VICReg objectiv to the downsampled vector representation of a UNet, training until convergence. It includes an covariance loss, which acts as an attractive force between the representations, and the variance loss, which prevents collapse by enforcing feature variance. Both these terms are scaled with a coefficient of 25. The covariance loss, which aims to decorrelate individual representation feature, is not scaled, in line with the suggestions from the VICReg paper. Our implementation, which is used for pre-training UNet is done in this [VICReg Training Notebook](https://github.com/lutai14/CAMUS-challenge/blob/main/gino_baseline/vicreg.ipynb), and the VICReg module itself is imeplemented in the [vicreg.py](https://github.com/lutai14/CAMUS-challenge/blob/main/gino_baseline/vicreg.py) script.
